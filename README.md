## Overview 

The purpose of this project was to analyze a large data set of employees data with over 300,000 employees in order to prepare Bobby's manager for the "silver tsunami", which is an upcoming retirement period for employees. I will be analyzing employees eligible for reitrement and mentorship programs using PostgreSQL.
