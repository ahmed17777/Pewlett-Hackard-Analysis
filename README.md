## Overview 

The purpose of this project was to analyze a large data set of employees data with over 300,000 employees in order to prepare Bobby's manager for the "silver tsunami", which is an upcoming retirement period for employees. I will be analyzing employees eligible for reitrement and mentorship programs using PostgreSQL. 

## ERD Schema 
Below is the ERD schema for this project.

## Results 

The following is a breakdown of the results from the analysis: 

### Number of retiring employees by title. 
- From a total of 300,004 employees, 30% (90,398) are eligible for retirement. 
- As shown in the image below, Senior Engineers hold the largest share (10%) of employees that may be ready for retirement.

### Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program 
- From the mentorship eligibility table created in Deliverable 2, I ran a count of employees eligible for the mentorship program by job title shown by the image below. I found that 1,549 of the 300,004 employees were eligible for the mentorship program. 
- Senior staff hold the majority share (28%) of employees that are eligible for the mentorship program.

## Summary 

Based on my analysis, 90,398 roles will need to be filled when the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact at Pewlett-Hackard. Seeing the results of the mentorship program eligibilty shows us that there is a huge discrepency between the number of employees ready to retire and the number of employees that are eligble for mentorship, which will cause the company to face a great deficit once the eligible employees retire. Some other tables that could provide us further inside into the upcoming "silver tsunami" would be: 

- How long employees have been in their current roles to identify employees that may be added to the mentorship program 
- What percentage of employees are new employees that may not be eligible for senior roles
